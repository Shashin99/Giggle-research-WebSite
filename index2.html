                    <p class="p-text">
                    General cognition training websites such as Lumosity [1] and CogniFit [2] improve attention and memory but lack domain-specific features for dyscalculia relative to software such as “Nanashilpa” [3], “EdSense” [4] and “Sankalpa Math Master” [5]. [6] describes a screening and intervention framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest to screen for dyscalculia and dysgraphia in Sri Lankan primary schools, but CNNs require large datasets while SVMs are challenged to address variation in behavior. The existing assessment systems still lack adaptive questioning and individualized intervention. Future studies must integrate AI-based personalized learning approaches to 
                    enhance dyscalculia diagnosis and intervention, ensuring tailored support for disabled students.

                    <p class="p-text">Research on German dyscalculic students [7] shows that the integration of sensual stimuli, mixed reality simulators, 
                        and virtual theaters in Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) based on "Dybuster Calcularis" is effective. 
                        However, it lacks real-time behavior monitoring to ascertain student engagement and emotional responses. Study [8], 
                        an electronic resource in Kuala Lumpur, Mont Kiara, improves concentration and interest using pictorial content and 
                        pedagogies but does not have interactive exercises of visualization through which students may explore concepts in a 
                        dynamic sense. “D-KNIGHTS” a fourth-grade dyscalculic students' 3D game, promotes strategic mathematical thinking through 
                        drag-and-drop exercises and teacher-controlled learning [9]. Comparatively, the gamification system [10] applies a 
                        Game Development Life Cycle (GDLC) approach with three gaming methods: Piano Game, Drawer Game, and Harvest Fruit Game, 
                        based on visual contrast. Despite there exist loopholes in monitoring students' emotions, 
                        embedding interactive visualization, and adaptive practice drills.</p>

                    <p class="p-text">Students should be taught to understand and follow mathematical procedures, rules and sequences.
                        "Kidkanit" explores how to assist dyscalculic students in mastering the fundamentals of mathematics through 
                        computer-assisted instruction (CAI). However, it lacks a systematic approach to teaching and practicing 
                        procedural mathematics, which is essential for longterm retention [11]. The article "Hand Gesture Recognition 
                        with Inertial Sensors" highlights the potential of an inertial sensor-based approach to hand gesture 
                        recognition to enhance dyscalculic students' math learning and problem-solving ability [12]. 
                        Students with graphical dyscalculia are guided in writing numbers through lessons by "Ganitha Piyasa". 
                        Using the MNIST dataset and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), their performance is assessed in terms of 
                        accuracy and completion time, with 98.3% accuracy achievement but does not examine students' procedural 
                        understanding [13]. Similarly, the system [14] evaluated CNN-based handwriting recognition, proving its 
                        effectiveness in detecting numerical writing errors, using the MNIST dataset for test benchmark due to its 
                        large population and variability. Despite advancements, gaps are still present in procedural math practice, 
                        gesture monitoring, handwriting analysis, and monitoring learning progress for dyscalculic students. </p>

                    <p class="p-text">Research [15]identifies verbal dyscalculia in primary school children, where users are prompted 
                        to select correct responses based on background voice instructions. It employs a CNN model with 91% accuracy 
                        and a 0.32 test error, which helps in early detection, however, target do not detect pronunciation issues. 
                        Study [16] introduced a voice chat feature via Natural Language Processing (NLP) and voice recognition to 
                        assist dyscalculic pupils in providing responses verbally but it lacks proper structuring in how oral math 
                        exercises are instructed, as only elementary interaction is accommodated. Study [17] proves that deep 
                        learning algorithms enhance mathematics understanding by way of chatbot-supported verbal communication, 
                        helping kids with pronunciation. Nevertheless, it does not offer real-time assessment of verbal skill, 
                        restricting it to monitor improvements in the long run. A clever voice conversation system [18] for Android 
                        augments speech recognition and synthesis, highlighting the role of saying numbers out loud in mathematical education. Nevertheless, 
                        it does not integrate adaptive learning with respect to verbal answers.  </p>

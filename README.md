# Giggle: A Place Where Every Child Learns to Love Math 🎓🧠📱

> An AI-powered adaptive learning platform designed to support children with dyscalculia through real-time feedback, emotional monitoring, and engaging multisensory technologies.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Giggle** is a research-driven mobile application that supports young students struggling with dyscalculia — a learning difficulty affecting math comprehension. By leveraging AI, AR, emotion recognition, and gesture-based interaction, Giggle identifies and supports semantic, procedural, and verbal dyscalculia. This platform aims to foster a personalized and supportive math learning environment.

The **Giggle Research Website** serves as a central hub to showcase our:
- Literature survey
- Research gap and problem
- Objectives
- Methodology
- Technology stack
- Milestones
- Team members
- Project documents & presentations
